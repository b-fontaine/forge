//! Feature-gated (`temporal-sdk`) native Temporal SDK access — OFF by default.
//!
//! The native Rust Temporal SDK (`temporalio-sdk` / `temporalio-client`) is
//! **Public Preview / pre-alpha** — per infra/temporal.md the API "can and will
//! continue to evolve". Default builds therefore do NOT compile it, keeping
//! `cargo build`/`test` hermetic and stable across toolchains.
//!
//! Enable with `cargo build --features temporal-sdk` to pull the pinned crates and
//! wire a real **activity-only** worker: register [`crate::activity`]
//! implementations on the substrate worker, and connect via `temporalio_client`.
//! Take the exact worker/client builder API from the pinned crate's docs — do NOT
//! invent method names; the API changes between versions.
//!
//! Verify-then-pin LIVE 2026-07-10 (`.forge/research/b6-2-verify-then-pin.md`):
//! `temporalio-sdk = 0.5.0`, `temporalio-client = 0.5.0` (proven to build).
